LICENSE AGREEMENT


    Preamble

The purpose of this license agreement is to grant users the personal,
limited, non-transferable, royalty-free right to use and modify the
Software for non-profit and non-commercial research or educational purposes
only. The main objective of this license agreement is to ensure reproducible
research results published in a scientific article.

The exercising of this right is conditional upon certain obligations for
users.

In consideration of access to the source code and the rights to copy,
and modify granted by the license, users are provided only
with a limited warranty and the software's author and the holder of the
economic rights only have limited liability.

In this respect, the risks associated with loading, using, modifying
and/or developing or reproducing the software by the user are brought to
the user's attention, which may make it complicated to use, with the
result that its use is reserved for developers and experienced professionals
having in-depth computer knowledge. Users are therefore encouraged to load
and test the suitability of the software as regards their requirements in
conditions enabling the security of their systems and/or data to be ensured
and, more generally, to use and operate it in the same conditions of
security.
